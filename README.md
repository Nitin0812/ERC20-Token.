# Project Name: Toroid Network ERC20 Token


Welcome to the Toroid Network ERC20 Token project! This project aims to create an ERC20 token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with the assistance of OpenZeppelin, a widely trusted library for building secure smart contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

About Toroid Network ERC20 Token:

Toroid Network is a decentralized ERC20 token built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain. The token adheres to the ERC20 standard, providing compatibility with various decentralized applications (dApps), exchanges, and wallets.

Key Features:

ERC20 Standard Compliance: Toroid Network ERC20 token adheres to the ERC20 standard, ensuring compatibility with the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain ecosystems.

Built with OpenZeppelin: The smart contract for Toroid Network token is created using OpenZeppelin, a library known for its robustness and security in smart contract development.

Name and Decimals: Toroid Network token is named "Toroid Network" and has 18 decimal places, providing precision and flexibility in token transactions.

Binance Smart Chain Compatibility: Being built on the Binance Smart Chain, Toroid Network token benefits from its high throughput, low transaction fees, and interoperability with the Binance ecosystem.

Community Governance: As the Toroid Network community grows, governance mechanisms can be implemented to give token holders a voice in the direction of the project.

Transparent and Open Source: The smart contract code for Toroid Network ERC20 token is open source and transparent, allowing anyone to review the code for security and trustworthiness.

Getting Started:

To get started with Toroid Network ERC20 token, you can follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or copy the code from "troid.sol" and paste it in your remix.etherium IDE by creating new file in contracts folder, file name should have ".sol" extension 
Set up your development environment for Solidity smart contract development.
Customize the token parameters such as name, symbol, and initial supply as per your requirements.
Deploy the smart contract to the Binance Smart Chain testnet or mainnet using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
Interact with the deployed contract using wallets or blockchain explorers to test its functionality.
